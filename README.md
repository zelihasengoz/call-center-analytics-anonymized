# 📊 Call Center Interaction Reporting (Anonymized Real Data)

> ⚠️ **Notice:** This project is based on a real-world CRM use case. All sensitive data such as lead names, user names, and contact information has been **anonymized** using consistent dummy values for privacy and confidentiality. Visualizations accurately reflect real behavior patterns.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Main script. It runs the report generation logic via `utils.py`.
- **`utils.py`**: Connects to the Kommo API, fetches data, processes it, and exports `.csv` files.
- **`analysis_talk.py`**: Creates visualizations based on conversation (talk) data. Outputs are saved in `talk_analysis_visuals/`.
- **`analysis_lead.py`**: Generates visual analytics based on lead creation data. Saved in `lead_report_visuals/`.
- **`config.py`**: Stores API access configurations like `BASE_URL` and `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## ⚙️ Main Functions

- `generate_daily_talk_report(output_to_csv=True)`  
  → Fetches and processes call center talk records from the Kommo CRM API.  
  → Output: `dummy_talk_report_with_response_times.csv`

- `generate_daily_lead_report(output_to_csv=True)`  
  → Fetches and processes lead creation records from the Kommo CRM API.  
  → Output: `dummy_lead_creation_report.csv`

Each function outputs anonymized `.csv` files and optionally generates `.png` visual reports.

## 📦 Output Files

> 🛡️ **Note**: Original filenames (e.g., `kommo_daily_lead_creation_report.csv`) have been anonymized for public sharing.

- `dummy_talk_report_with_response_times.csv`  
- `dummy_lead_creation_report.csv`  
- `.png` visualization files located in:
  - `talk_analysis_visuals/`
  - `lead_report_visuals/`

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

Below are some examples of visual outputs automatically generated by the analysis scripts:

### 🔹 Hourly Lead Creation by User  
_Heatmap of lead creation trends per user (hourly resolution)._

> Users have been renamed (e.g., User 1–11) to maintain confidentiality.  
> Visuals provide real behavioral insights despite anonymization.
